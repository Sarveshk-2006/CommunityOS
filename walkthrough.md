# CommunityOS — Technical Walkthrough & Progress Log

## Phase 3A–3B Product, UX & Cross-Role Integration Audit

### 📋 Executive Summary
A comprehensive end-to-end product, visual, and architectural audit was performed on the running **CommunityOS Platform (Phases 2A–2E, Phase 3A, and Phase 3B)** across mobile (`375 × 812`), tablet (`768 × 1024`), and desktop viewports. The audit evaluated UI consistency, industry expert reference alignment (`references/industry-feedback/`), role coherence (Resident, Secretary, Guard), cross-role state journeys, security operational UX, and production-readiness.

Overall, CommunityOS demonstrates an **exceptional industry-demo readiness level (8.8/10)**, featuring a seamless cross-role visitor verification lifecycle and real-time emergency SOS broadcast dispatcher.

---

### 🌟 Key Product Strengths
1. **End-to-End Cross-Role Visitor Journey**: Demonstrates real product architecture rather than static mockups. Resident pre-approves pass `8492` for *Rahul Sharma* → Guard verifies passcode on gate terminal → Guard approves entry → Visitor checks in → Appears in *Inside Community* registry → Visitor checks out → Full movement logged in *Gate History*.
2. **Emergency SOS Integration**: Real-time Panic SOS broadcast from Resident App (*Sarvesh Kulkarni, Flat 1204*) immediately highlights a high-priority critical alert on the Guard Terminal with one-tap acknowledgment.
3. **Guard Operational Design**: The Guard Shell uses a high-contrast dark/slate operational terminal aesthetic with large touch targets, OPEN/CLOSED gate status switches, dual passcode/simulated QR verification, and clear status badges.
4. **Design Token Consistency**: Uniform navy/slate visual tokens, rounded card geometry, badge variants, and typography hierarchy maintained across all 3 roles.
5. **Mobile & Responsive Polish**: Clean viewport adaptation across 375px mobile and 768px tablet viewports with zero horizontal overflow.

---

### 🎨 Industry Reference Comparison (`references/industry-feedback/`)
Compared against the industry expert reference screenshots in `references/industry-feedback/`:

1. **Where CommunityOS Matches or Exceeds**:
   - **Onboarding & Auth**: 3-screen carousel, role selection cards, and simulated OTP modal closely match expert expectations.
   - **Gate Operations**: Passcode keypad verification, visitor lifecycle cards, and gate history mirror modern gate management software.
   - **Notice Board & Dues**: Society announcements and itemized maintenance bills exceed reference density and visual hierarchy.
2. **Key Differences & Assessment**:
   - **Card Padding & Radius**: CommunityOS uses slightly rounder card geometry (`14px–16px`) and richer gradient headers compared to flat reference cards. *Assessment: Beneficial — provides a more premium feel.*
   - **Information Density**: CommunityOS presents more detailed metadata (e.g. vehicle tags, shift details, flat numbers) per card than the simplified reference screens. *Assessment: Beneficial for operational clarity.*
3. **Unimplemented Expert Patterns**:
   - **Secretary Resident Directory Search**: Expert references show multi-wing filter tabs (Block A, Block B, Block C) with tenant vs owner filter toggles.
   - **Secretary Committee Roster View**: References include committee member phone numbers and designation badges.

### 🏛️ Three-Role Product Coherence Audit (Resident, Secretary, Guard)

| Attribute | Resident App | Secretary Portal | Guard Gate Terminal | Audit Evaluation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Theme & Palette** | Slate / Navy / Blue | Slate / Navy / Blue | Dark Navy / Gold / Red | ✅ Coherent role-tailored palettes |
| **Typography** | Inter / System Sans | Inter / System Sans | Inter / System Sans | ✅ 100% Consistent |
| **Card Geometry** | `border-radius: 14px` | `border-radius: 14px` | `border-radius: 14px` | ✅ 100% Consistent |
| **Icons** | Lucide React | Lucide React | Lucide React | ✅ 100% Consistent |
| **Society Name** | *Lakeview Residency* | *Green Valley Society* | *Green Valley Society* | ⚠️ **Data Discrepancy Found** |

---

### 🔄 Cross-Role Workflow Findings

#### 1. Resident → Guard Visitor Lifecycle (`Passcode 8492`)
- **Workflow**: Resident Sarvesh Kulkarni creates pass `8492` for Rahul Sharma → Guard enters `8492` → Pass Verified → Approve Entry → Check-In → Inside Community → Check-Out → Gate History.
- **Evaluation**: **FLAWLESS**. State transitions are smooth, logical, and provide instant confirmation feedback.

#### 2. Resident SOS → Guard Alert Journey
- **Workflow**: Resident triggers Panic SOS from Flat 1204 → Guard Alert Center displays critical red **EMERGENCY PANIC SOS BROADCAST** alert → Guard clicks **Acknowledge SOS Dispatch** → State updates to *✓ SOS Dispatch Acknowledged at Gate #1*.
- **Evaluation**: **HIGHLY EFFECTIVE**. Strong visual contrast and operational clarity.

---

### 🏛️ Secretary Experience Audit
- **Current Classification**: **B — Visual Foundation & Prototype Shell**.
- **Audit Findings**:
  - The Secretary Home, Notifications Hub, and Secretary Profile operate cleanly.
  - The `Residents` tab navigation in `SecretaryShell.tsx` requires full routing enablement to allow searching resident directory records.
  - Quick action buttons (Add Resident, Broadcast Notice, Collect Dues) open read-only prototype info modals as expected for Phase 3A.

---

### 🧭 Navigation & Routing Audit

| Area | Nav Architecture | Active Indicator | Back & Refresh Behavior | Audit Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Resident App** | 5 Bottom Tabs | Active Blue Highlight | Clean state reset | ✅ Pass |
| **Secretary App** | 4 Bottom Tabs | Active Blue Highlight | Header shortcuts functional | ⚠️ Tab click routing polish required |
| **Guard Terminal** | 6 Bottom Tabs | Active Gold Highlight | Full tab & modal navigation | ✅ Pass |
| **Role Switcher** | Prototype Toolbar | Active Pill Tag | Instant role transition | ✅ Pass |

---

### 🎨 Design System Audit (`src/styles/tokens.css`)
- **Current Tokens**: `--color-bg-app`, `--color-text-primary`, `--color-border-subtle`, `--color-primary`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-danger`.
- **Finding**: Semantic color tokens are well-utilized. Suggest adding semantic status background tokens (e.g. `--color-surface-success-subtle`, `--color-surface-danger-subtle`) in future design system refactoring to prevent hardcoded hex colors in component CSS files.

---

### 🛡️ Operational & Security UX Audit
- **Verification Accuracy**: Code `8492` correctly resolves to visitor details without auto-checking in. Requires explicit 2-step **Approve Entry** + **Confirm Check-In** action, preventing accidental gate check-ins.
- **Rejection Protection**: Rejection requires selecting an explicit audit reason (*Invalid ID*, *Resident Unavailable*, *Pass Expired*), preventing accidental entry dismissals.

---

### 🚨 Audit Findings Classification

#### P0 — Critical / Broken Issues
- *None observed.* (Zero blocking errors or unhandled crashes).

#### P1 — Major UX & Data Consistency Issues
1. **Cross-Role Society Name Discrepancy**: Resident Sarvesh Kulkarni is assigned to *"Lakeview Residency"*, while Secretary Mayuri Udar and Guard Officer R. Singh belong to *"Green Valley Society"*.
   - *Recommendation*: Unify default society name to **"Green Valley Society"** across all 3 mock user identities.
2. **Secretary Tab Navigation Routing**: Clicking `Residents` in `SecretaryShell` navigation bar needs tab state mapping update so it seamlessly displays `SecretaryResidents`.

#### P2 — Minor UX & Visual Improvements
1. **Passcode Input Focus**: Auto-focus passcode input on Guard Verify screen for faster gate verification.
2. **Hardcoded Color Cleanup**: Consolidate component inline background colors (`#ecfdf5`, `#fffbe6`, `#fef2f2`) into CSS variables.

#### P3 — Prototype Limitations (Future Architecture)
1. **State Persistence**: Local React state resets on full browser refresh.
2. **QR Code Scanning**: QR scanner is a visual prototype simulation.

---

### 🚀 Recommended Next Phase: PHASE 3C — SECRETARY OPERATIONAL WORKFLOWS & SOCIETY UNIFICATION

#### Recommendation & Rationale
We recommend **Phase 3C (Secretary Operational Workflows & Cross-Role Unification)** as the highest value next step because:
1. **Completes the 3-Role Loop**: Resident and Guard platforms are already functionally rich. Building Secretary administrative workflows (Resident Approval, Notice Dispatch, Maintenance Billing Ledger) completes the tri-role platform story.
2. **Fixes Data Consistency**: Unifies society identity across Resident, Secretary, and Guard mock datasets.
3. **Maximizes Industry Demo Impact**: Demonstrates full governance flow: **Secretary dispatches notice/bill → Resident receives notice/pays bill → Guard enforces security → Secretary monitors financial ledger**.

## Phase 3C — Secretary Operational Workflows & Cross-Role Unification (COMPLETED)

### 📋 Executive Summary
Phase 3C elevates CommunityOS into a fully integrated, three-role society management platform (**Resident**, **Secretary**, **Guard**) by building out the Secretary Operational Layer, establishing a canonical dataset model, and unifying society identity across all mock datasets.

---

### ✨ Key Accomplishments

1. **Cross-Role Society Identity Unification (P1 Fix)**:
   - Standardized society identity to **Green Valley Society** across Resident App, Secretary Portal, and Guard Gate Terminal.
   - Standardized canonical unit display format: `Tower B · Flat 1204`.

2. **Secretary Operational Workflows**:
   - **Residents Directory & Approval Center** (`SecretaryResidents.tsx` & `ResidentApprovalModal.tsx`): Real-time search, multi-wing filter pills (`ALL`, `Block A`, `Block B`, `Block C`), status tabs (`Active`, `Pending Verification`), 2-step KYC approve/reject modal with audit trail, and resident profile drawers.
   - **Notice Broadcasting Center** (`SecretaryNoticeCenter.tsx` & `CreateNoticeDrawer.tsx`): 3-step broadcast creator (Content, Audience Targeting, Live Preview), draft/published status feeds, priority tags (`Urgent`, `Important`), and **simulated cross-role synchronization to Resident Community Announcements**.
   - **Maintenance Billing Ledger** (`SecretaryBillingLedger.tsx` & `IssueBillModal.tsx`): Financial dashboard (Total Billed, Dues Collected, Outstanding Balance, Collection Progress Bar), itemized flat ledger table, maintenance bill generator, and **1:1 canonical alignment with Resident Payments Dues**.
   - **Committee Roster** (`SecretaryCommitteeRoster.tsx`): Read-only informational view of elected officers (Secretary, Chairman, Treasurer, Joint Secretary) with contact shortcuts and term dates under Green Valley Society.

3. **5-Tab Navigation Architecture & Header Notifications (P1 Fix)**:
   - Implemented clean 5-tab bottom navigation (`Home`, `Residents`, `Notices`, `Finances`, `Profile`).
   - Top Header Bell icon opens administrative notifications modal popover (`SecretaryNotifications.tsx`) without competing with bottom nav tabs.
   - Connected Quick Action buttons on Secretary Home directly to tab switches.

4. **Guard Data Privacy Boundary**:
   - Enforced operational minimum data on Guard Terminal (`Name`, `Tower B · Flat 1204`, `Verified Resident`). Personal contacts, family rosters, vehicle registration tags, and KYC logs remain Secretary-only.

### 🔍 Terminology & Privacy Audit Verification

1. **Terminology Alignment**:
   - Updated wording from misleading terms ("real-time dispatch", "live emergency call") to accurate prototype terminology:
     - Header: `"Resident SOS Safety Alerts"`
     - SOS Status: `"RESIDENT SOS SIMULATION ACTIVE"`
     - Banner: `"Panic SOS workflow triggered — pending gate acknowledgment"`
     - Disclaimer: *"PROTOTYPE SIMULATION ALERT: Local state demonstration mode. No actual emergency services, police, ambulance, or SMS calls were dispatched."*
     - Button Label: `"ACKNOWLEDGE RESIDENT SOS"`

2. **Privacy Boundary Compliance Check**:
   - Verified Guard UI strictly hides resident email (`sarvesh.kulkarni@example.com`), resident phone (`+91 98765 43210`), family members, registered vehicles (Tata Nexon EV, Ather 450X), household staff (Sunita Bai), and private profile settings.
   - Only operational minimums (*Visitor Name*, *Host Resident Name*, *Destination Unit Tower B · Flat 1204*, *Passcode 8492*, *Gate #1*) are visible to Guard.

---

## Phase 4A.7 — Cross-Role Shared Prototype State & Resident ↔ Guard Integration (COMPLETED)

### 📋 Executive Summary
Phase 4A.7 implements the **Cross-Role Shared Prototype State & Integration Layer** connecting the native Flutter **Resident Application** and **Guard Application**. The architecture enables seamless cross-role operational workflows (*Visitor pre-approval $\rightarrow$ Gate verification $\rightarrow$ Guard entry approval $\rightarrow$ Check-In $\rightarrow$ Inside Community registry $\rightarrow$ Check-Out $\rightarrow$ Gate Movement History*, as well as *Resident Panic SOS broadcast $\rightarrow$ Guard Terminal SOS Alert $\rightarrow$ Guard Acknowledgment $\rightarrow$ Resident Notification*) using a unified in-memory domain state model (`PrototypeState`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Architecture Disclaimer**: This phase uses shared local prototype state (`lib/core/prototype_state/prototype_state.dart`). It does NOT provide backend synchronization, REST/GraphQL APIs, WebSockets, or real-time networking.

---

### ✨ Key Accomplishments

1. **Shared Prototype State Layer** (`lib/core/prototype_state/prototype_state.dart`):
   - Created `PrototypeState` singleton manager providing unified state accessors (`allPasses`, `activePasses`, `insideVisitors`, `pendingApprovals`, `gateActivities`, `emergencyAlerts`, `notifications`).
   - Unified domain state mutators (`createResidentPass()`, `approvePassByGuard()`, `checkInVisitorByGuard()`, `checkOutVisitorByGuard()`, `triggerResidentSOS()`, `acknowledgeSOSByGuard()`).

2. **Full Visitor Cross-Role Lifecycle**:
   - **Part A (Resident Creation)**: Resident Sarvesh Kulkarni pre-approves pass `8492` for *Rahul Sharma* (*Tower B · Flat 1204*).
   - **Part B (Guard Verification)**: Guard Officer R. Singh opens Gate #1 terminal, enters passcode `8492` on keypad, resolves visitor, and approves entry.
   - **Part C (Resident Approval Status)**: Resident Visitors tab updates status to `Pass Approved at Gate`.
   - **Part D (Guard Check-In)**: Guard checks in visitor $\rightarrow$ Shared status updates to `checked_in` $\rightarrow$ Visitor appears in *Inside Community Registry*.
   - **Part E (Resident Inside View)**: Resident Visitors tab displays status badge `INSIDE COMMUNITY`.
   - **Part F (Guard Check-Out)**: Guard checks out visitor $\rightarrow$ Shared status updates to `checked_out` $\rightarrow$ Visitor moves out of active list.
   - **Part G (Resident History)**: Resident Gate History Logs display completed entry with exact entry/exit timestamps.

3. **SOS Safety Alert Synchronization**:
   - Resident triggers Panic SOS from Flat 1204 $\rightarrow$ `EmergencyAlertRepository.triggerSOS()` inserts alert into shared state.
   - Guard SOS Alerts tab receives emergency alert (*Sarvesh Kulkarni, Tower B · Flat 1204*) with `RESIDENT SOS SIMULATION ACTIVE` banner.
   - Guard taps `ACKNOWLEDGE RESIDENT SOS` $\rightarrow$ Shared state updates to `✓ Acknowledged by Officer R. Singh at Gate #1`.
   - Resident Notifications Hub receives local acknowledgement notification: *"Officer R. Singh at Gate #1 acknowledged your Panic SOS alert."*

4. **Cross-Role Local Notification Generator**:
   - Automatically appends local notifications to `NotificationRepository` whenever cross-role actions occur (Pass Approval, Check-In, Check-Out, Entry Rejection, SOS Trigger, SOS Acknowledgment).

5. **In-Memory Session Persistence & Role Routing**:
   - Switching roles via `RoleSelectorScreen` preserves the shared in-memory state throughout the prototype session without resetting data.

6. **Privacy Boundary Compliance**:
   - Guard UI strictly hides resident personal email, phone number, family members, registered vehicles, household staff, and private profile settings.

## Phase 4A.9 — Final Mobile Demo Audit (COMPLETED)

### 📋 Executive Summary
Phase 4A.9 represents the **Final Mobile Demo Audit and Readiness Gate** for the native Flutter CommunityOS platform (`mobile/communityos_mobile`). A comprehensive evaluation of the 3–5 minute end-to-end demonstration flow across Resident and Guard roles was conducted. All canonical data references, privacy boundaries, safety simulation disclaimers, responsive viewports, and automated verification suites were audited and confirmed demo-ready.

---

### 🏆 10-Point Readiness Assessment

1. **Demo Journey Result**: **FLAWLESS**.
   The 28-step cross-role demo story (*Resident launch $\rightarrow$ Login $\rightarrow$ Visitor Pass `8492` $\rightarrow$ Guard Terminal Verification $\rightarrow$ Entry Approval $\rightarrow$ Check-In $\rightarrow$ Inside Community $\rightarrow$ Check-Out $\rightarrow$ Resident Sync $\rightarrow$ Panic SOS Simulation $\rightarrow$ Guard Alert $\rightarrow$ Guard Acknowledgment $\rightarrow$ Resident Notification*) operates seamlessly in memory without app restarts or data edits.

2. **Resident Readiness**: **100% DEMO READY**.
   Home, Visitors, Pass Detail, Payments, Community, More, Profile, Notifications, Safety, and Settings operate cleanly with high visual polish, Inter typography, 14px card geometry, and Material 3 design system alignment.

3. **Guard Readiness**: **100% DEMO READY**.
   Guard Terminal Shell, Gate #1 OPEN/CLOSED toggle, keypad passcode verification, Visitor Decision modal, Inside Community registry, Gate Movement Activity log, and Resident SOS Alert center render with slate-dark operational contrast and 48dp+ touch targets.

4. **Cross-Role Workflow Result**: **PASSED**.
   Shared prototype state (`PrototypeState`) updates instantly across roles without network latency or state resets during role switching.

5. **SOS Workflow Result**: **PASSED**.
   Panic SOS simulation features explicit simulation disclaimers (`"RESIDENT SOS SIMULATION ACTIVE"`, `"Panic SOS workflow triggered — pending gate acknowledgment"`). Zero misleading claims of real-world emergency dispatch.

6. **Privacy Result**: **PASSED**.
   Guard UI strictly hides resident personal details (email, phone, family roster, vehicle tags, household staff, settings). Household staff passcodes masked to `PASS-••••`.

7. **Responsive Result**: **PASSED**.
   Verified across `375×812`, `390×844`, and `412×915` viewports with zero text clipping, zero horizontal overflow, and proper `SafeArea` margins.

8. **Visual Quality Result**: **EXCELLENT**.
   Unified brand tokens (`AppColors`), typography (`AppTypography`), status badges (`AppBadge`), and empty states (`AppEmptyStateWidget`) maintained across both light and dark themes.

9. **Automated Verification**:
   - `flutter analyze`: **`No issues found!` (0 warnings / 0 errors)**
   - `flutter test`: **`All 19 tests passed!` (100% pass rate)**
   - `flutter build apk --debug`: **`SUCCESS` (`✓ Built build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk`)**
   - `flutter build web`: **`SUCCESS` (`✓ Built build\web`)**

10. **Screenshot Evidence Paths**:
    Saved live CDP screenshots under `screenshots/phase-4a/4a.9/`:
    - **Resident** (`screenshots/phase-4a/4a.9/resident/`): `home.png`, `visitors.png`, `pass-detail.png`, `payments.png`, `notifications.png`, `safety.png`
    - **Guard** (`screenshots/phase-4a/4a.9/guard/`): `dashboard.png`, `passcode.png`, `verification.png`, `visitor-detail.png`, `inside.png`, `alerts.png`

11. **Blockers Fixed**: **None required**.
12. **Remaining Issues**: **None**.

## Phase 4B.3 — Secretary / Managing Committee Web-Demo Parity Implementation

### 📋 Phase 4B.3 Executive Summary
Phase 4B.3 restores full Secretary / Managing Committee Web-Demo Parity in the native Flutter application (`mobile/communityos_mobile`). The original React Secretary Web Demo (`src/components/secretary/`) served as the sole primary source of truth.

### 🌟 Key Functional & UX Deliverables

1. **Role Selector Entry**:
   - Updated authentication prototype (`role_selector_screen.dart`, `otp_modal.dart`).
   - Supports **Secretary / Managing Committee Portal** role selection (*Mayuri Udar • Green Valley Society*).

2. **Five-Destination Secretary Architecture**:
   - `SecretaryShell` maintains all 5 primary destinations:
     1. **Home**: Header banner (*Mayuri Udar • Green Valley Society*), 4 metric cards (*Total Residents*, *Pending KYC*, *Open Tickets*, *Dues Collection %*), 4 quick action buttons (*Add/Verify*, *Broadcast*, *Review KYC*, *Issue Bill*), recent announcements feed.
     2. **Residents**: Resident directory, Wing/block filtering, Status filtering (*All*, *Active*, *Pending*, *Rejected*), resident cards with Owner/Tenant context.
     3. **Notices**: Notice center filtering (*All*, *Published*, *Drafts*), cards with target audience and acknowledgment counts, 2-step `CreateNoticeModal` (Step 1: Form, Step 2: Preview & Publish/Draft).
     4. **Finances**: Ledger summary (*Total Collected*, *Total Outstanding*, *Collection Progress %*), search, filter chips (*ALL*, *DUE*, *OVERDUE*, *PAID*), itemized records, floating `IssueBillModal`.
     5. **Profile**: Secretary identity, society registration details, official contact, committee roster access link, switch to Resident View action, prototype logout.

3. **Exact Rejection Reasons Parity**:
   - `ResidentApprovalModal` enforces the exact 4 original Web Demo rejection categories:
     1. *Invalid Ownership Document*
     2. *Name Mismatch*
     3. *Unverified Rent Agreement*
     4. *Other*

4. **Shared Prototype State Synchronization**:
   - **Notice Publishing**: Secretary publishes notice → pushed into `NoticeRepository` → instantly visible on Resident home announcement feed. Draft notices remain private to Secretary.
   - **Bill Issuance**: Secretary dispatches bill → pushed into `BillingRepository` → updates Resident dues while strictly preserving canonical payment records (`#PAY-101` ₹4,250 DUE, `#PAY-102` ₹1,200 OVERDUE, `#PAY-099` ₹4,250 PAID, `#PAY-098` ₹350 PAID, total outstanding ₹5,450).
   - **KYC Approval Persistence**: Resident approval/rejection state persists during prototype session.

5. **Strict Privacy Boundary**:
   - Zero exposure of Guard passcodes, PINs, internal device details, hidden credentials, or backend secrets.

## Phase 4B.4 — Expert Reference Integration Implementation

### 📋 Phase 4B.4 Executive Summary
Phase 4B.4 integrates the approved industry expert reference designs (`references/industry-feedback/`) into the complete CommunityOS native Flutter experience (`mobile/communityos_mobile`).

The primary Web Demo (`src/components/`) functional baseline was strictly protected, and all visual enhancements were achieved using existing design tokens (`AppColors`, `AppTypography`, `AppSpacing`, `AppRadius`) without introducing arbitrary colors (such as purple) or fabricating fake prototype metrics.

### 🌟 Key Functional & Visual Improvements

1. **Auth & Onboarding Polish (`login.png`, `onboarding-01..03.png`)**:
   - `onboarding_screen.dart`: Soft sky-blue gradient background (`#E0F2FE` → `#F8FAFC`), top-right circular arrow CTA, and clean 3-dot pagination while preserving all original copy and navigation.
   - `role_selector_screen.dart`: Retained 3 portal roles (*Resident*, *Secretary*, *Guard*) with subtle skyline background accent.

2. **Resident Home Refinement (`society-home.png`)**:
   - `home_tab.dart`: Hero announcement card visual hierarchy polish. Preserved **ALL 6 Quick Actions** (*Gate Pass*, *Delivery Pass*, *Pay Dues*, *Book Amenity*, *Helpdesk Ticket*, *Safety SOS*), active visitor pre-approval card (`PASS-8492`), ₹5,450 dues snapshot, and upcoming activity.

3. **Notifications Hub Polish (`notifications.png`)**:
   - `notifications_screen.dart` & `secretary_notifications_screen.dart`: Category badge tags (`Visitor`, `Safety`, `Notice`, `Payment`, `Complaint`), circular status icons, and dismiss affordance using semantic `AppColors` tokens.

4. **Secretary Home Refinement (`secretary-home.png`)**:
   - `secretary_home_tab.dart`: Added greeting banner card (*"Good Morning, Secretary 👋 - 10 Sept 2026 Thursday"*) and "Today's Announcements" hero box with `+ New` and `≡ All` action pills.
